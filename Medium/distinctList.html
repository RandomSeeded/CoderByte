// Assignment: http://coderbyte.com/CodingArea/GuestEditor.php?ct=Distinct%20List&lan=JavaScript
//  Using the JavaScript language, have the function DistinctList(arr) take the array of numbers stored in arr and determine the total number of duplicate entries. For example if the input is [1, 2, 2, 2, 3] then your program should output 2 because there are two duplicates of one of the elements. 

// Can we abstract this? The inside, yes....we could definitely pass it a function....but the other 'stuff' around it not so much (e.g. the seen object, the initial value...also, if we did 'abstract' this, it would basically be a DO SOMETHING TO THE ARRAY...so we would have succesfully put a wrapper that accomplished nothing around a foreach. So...maybe not.

// Take1
function distinctList(arr) {
   var seen = {};
   return arr.reduce(function(numDupes, value) {
      if (seen.hasOwnProperty(value)) return numDupes+1;
      else {
         seen[value] = true;
         return numDupes;
      }
   },0);
}
console.log(distinctList([1,2,2,2,3]));
console.log(distinctList([0,-2,-2,5,5,5]));
console.log(distinctList([100,2,101,4]));
