// Assignment: http://coderbyte.com/CodingArea/GuestEditor.php?ct=Look%20Say%20Sequence&lan=JavaScript
//  Using the JavaScript language, have the function LookSaySequence(num) take the num parameter being passed and return the next number in the sequence according to the following rule: to generate the next number in a sequence read off the digits of the given number, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit. For example, the sequence beginning with 1 would be: 1, 11, 21, 1211, ... The 11 comes from there being "one 1" before it and the 21 comes from there being "two 1's" before it. So your program should return the next number in the sequence given num. 

// NOTE: this is a drastically simplified/easier version of what you already did for CodeWars. Take a look at that for a very complicated yet effective regexp

// Take1
function lookSaySequence(num) {
   var strNum = String(num);
   var currDigit = strNum.charAt(0);
   var digitOccurances = 1;
   var output = "";
   for (var i = 1; i < strNum.length; i++) {
      // same character
      if (strNum.charAt(i) === strNum.charAt(i-1)) {
         digitOccurances++;
      }
      // new character
      else {
         output+=digitOccurances+currDigit;
         currDigit = strNum.charAt(i);
         digitOccurances = 1;
      }
   }
   output+=digitOccurances+currDigit;
   return output;
}
console.log(fancySequence(1211));
console.log(fancySequence(2466));
